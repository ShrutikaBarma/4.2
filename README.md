Create an Express.js server that provides API endpoints to manage a playing card collection. The API should allow you to perform operations such as listing all cards, adding a new card (with properties like suit and value), retrieving a specific card by ID, and deleting a card by ID. Store card data in an in-memory array for simplicity.
